All of us users are well-aware and familiar with the current trending social media apps. Reverb would help you consistently target your daily milestones towards reaching your bigger goals. One of its prominent features include the "SWAT - Priority" feature which helps the user manage and create posts regarding their daily projects. 

Let's say: Example - User X is working on his Data Structures and Algo Skills. He/she can make a post on a daily basis regarding his/her progress explaining about the approach and technique while trying to solve any kind of problem. The visibility of the daily progression is upto him/her whether they want others to know about it or not. User Y working on his daily fitness journey, he/she can also participate through this platform to reach his daily goals for attaining his bigger milestones.
